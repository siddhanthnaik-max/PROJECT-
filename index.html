        <strong>
            REFLECTION :</strong>When a ray of light approaches a smooth polished 
            surface and the light ray bounces back, it is called the reflection of
             light. The incident light ray that land on the surface is reflected off
              the surface. The ray that bounces back is called the reflected ray. If
               a perpendicular were drawn on a reflecting surface, it would be called
                normal. The figure below shows the reflection of an incident beam on
                 a plane mirror.

    <p><strong>Example:</strong>Mirrors: A person seeing their own image in a bathroom or 
        car mirror.<br>Water surfaces: A still pond or lake creating a clear image of the 
        sky and surrounding trees</p>

    <p><strong>REFRACTION:</strong>Refraction is the bending of a wave when it passes from
         one medium to another. The bending is caused due to the differences in density between
          the two substances.</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong>Examples of light refraction include a straw or pencil
         appearing bent when submerged in water, a rainbow forming in the sky, and a
          swimming pool looking shallower than it is</p></section>

<h1>REFLECTION</h1>
    <h2>laws of reflection</h2>
    <p>The laws of reflection determine the reflection of incident light rays on reflecting surfaces
        , like mirrors, smooth metal surfaces and clear water. Let’s consider a plane mirror as shown 
        in the figure above. The law of reflection states that
        <br>1.Angle of incidence = Angle of reflection:<br>2.Plane of incidence: The incident ray, 
        the reflected ray, and the normal all lie in the same plane
    </p>

    <h2>Types of reflection of light</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Regular reflection is also known as specular reflection
        </li>
        <li>
            Diffused reflection
        </li>
        <li>
            Multiple reflection
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Regular/Specular Reflection</h2>
    <p>Specular Reflection refers to a clear and sharp reflection, like the ones you get in a mirror.
         A mirror is made of glass coated with a uniform layer of a highly reflective material such as
          powder. This reflective surface reflects almost all the light incident on it uniformly. There
           is not much variation in the angles of reflections between various points. This means that 
           the haziness and the blurring are almost entirely eliminated.</p>
           <img src="1.png">
    <h2>Diffused Reflection</h2>
    <p>Reflective surfaces other than mirrors, in general, have a very rough finish. This may be due to
         wear and tear such as scratches and dents or dirt on the surface. Sometimes even the material 
         of which the surface is made of matters. All this leads to a loss of both the brightness and 
         the quality of the reflection.<br>In the case of such rough surfaces, the angle of reflection 
         when compared between points is completely haphazard. For rough surfaces, the rays incident at 
         slightly different points on the surface is reflected in completely different directions. This 
         type of reflection is called diffused reflection and is what enables us to see non-shiny objects.
        </p>
        <img src="2.png">
    <h2>Multiple Reflection</h2>
    <p>A single image is formed when an object is placed in front of a mirror. What happens if we use two
         mirrors? Since reflective surfaces such as mirrors are very good at preserving the intensity of 
         light in a reflection, a single light source can be reflected multiple times. These multiple 
         reflections are possible until the intensity of light becomes low to the point that we cannot see.
          This means that we can have almost infinite multiple reflections. We can also see an image in 
          every individual reflection. This means that each image is the result of an image or an image of
           an image.</p>

<p>The number of images we see depends on the angle between the two mirrors. We see that as we go on decreasing
 the angle between the mirrors, the number of images increases. And when the angle becomes zero, i.e., when
  the mirrors become parallel, the number of images becomes infinite. This effect can be easily observed when
   your barber uses another smaller mirror to show you the back of your head. When this happens, not only do 
   you see the back of your head, but you also see innumerable images of yourself. The variation of the number
    of images of an object placed between two mirrors with the angle between the mirrors can be described by
     a simple formula:</p>

<h1>REFRACTION</h1>
<a href="#Solved Examples"><button>Solved Examples</button></a>
<h2>Causes Of Refraction</h2>
<p><strong>Change of Speed Results in Change in Direction</strong></p>
<p>A light ray refracts whenever it travels at an angle into a medium of different refractive indices.
     This change in speed results in a change in direction. As an example, consider air travelling into water.
      The speed of light decreases as it continues to travel at a different angle.</p>
      <img src="3.png">

<p>The refraction of light in glass is shown in the figure above. When light travels from air into glass, the
     light slows down and changes direction slightly. When light travels from a less dense substance to a denser
      substance, the refracted light bends more towards the normal line. If the light wave approaches the boundary
       in a perpendicular direction, the light ray doesn’t refract despite the change in speed.</p>
<h2>Laws of Refraction of Light</h2>
<p>Laws of refraction state that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The incident ray refracted ray, and the normal to the interface of two media at the point of incidence all
         lie on the same plane</li>
    <li>The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is constant. This is
         also known as Snell’s law of refraction</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>sin i/sin r = constant</strong></p>
<h2>What Is The Refractive Index</h2>
<p>The refractive index, also called the index of refraction, describes how fast light travels through the material   
</p>
<p>The refractive Index is dimensionless. For a given material, the refractive index is the ratio between the speed 
    of light in a vacuum (c) and the speed of light in the medium (v). If the refractive index for a medium is 
    represented by n, then it is given by the following formula
</p> 
<p><strong> n = e/v</strong></p> 
<p>Based on the refractive index of the medium, the light ray changes its direction, or it bends at the junction
     separating the two media. If the light ray travels from one medium to another of a higher refractive index,
      it bends towards the normal, else it bends away from the normal.
</p>
<h2>Refraction of light in real life</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
     Mirage and looming are optical illusions resulting from refraction of light.   
    </li>
    <li>
     A swimming pool always looks shallower than it really is because the light coming from the bottom of the pool
      bends at the surface due to refraction of light   
    </li>
    <li>Formation of a rainbow is an example of refraction as the sun rays bend through the raindrops resulting in
         the rainbow</li>
    
</ul>
<h2>Applications Of Refraction Of Light</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
      A lens uses refraction to form an image of an object for various purposes, such as magnification  
    </li>
    <li>
     Spectacles worn by people with defective vision use the principle of refraction   
    </li>
    <li>
      Refraction is used in peepholes of house doors, cameras, movie projectors and telescopes.  
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Solved Problems on Refraction</h2>
<p><strong>1.Light travelling in air enters into an optical fibre of refractive index 1.44</strong></p>
<ul><strong>
    <li>
        (a)In which direction does the light bend?
    </li>
    <li>(b)If the angle of incidence on one end of the fibre is 22o, then what is the angle of refraction?
</strong></ul>
    </li>
    <p>solution:</p>
    <p>
            (a)The light travels from a rarer medium(air) to a denser medium(optical fibre). Hence the
             refracted ray will bend towards the normal
            <br>(b) The angle of refraction can be calculated as follows:
    
    <br>Let air be medium 1 and optical fibre be medium 2. Therefore, n<sub>1</sub> = 1.00, n<sub>2</sub> = 1.44,
     and θ<sub>1</sub>= 22<sup>o</sup>
    <br>Now, substituting the values in the equation as follows:<br>(1.00) sin 22<sup>o</sup> = 1.44 sin θ2.<br>
sin θ<sub>2</sub> = (1.00/1.44) sin 22<sup>o</sup> = 0.260<br>
θ<sub>2</sub> = sin<sup>-1</sup> (0.260) = 15<sup>o</sup>
    </p>
    <p><strong>2.The light travelling through the optical fibre reaches the end of the optical fibre and exits 
        into the air. If the angle of incidence at the end of the tube is 30<sup>o</sup>. Then what would the angle of 
        refraction outside the fibre be?</strong></p>
    <p>solution:</p>
    <p>Let the fibre be medium 1 and air medium 2. Therefore, n1 = 1.44, n2 = 1.00, and θ,1 = 30<sup>o</sup>. Substituting
         the values in the equation, we get<br>
(1.44) sin 30<sup>o</sup> = 1.00 sin θ<sub>2</sub><br>
sin θ<sub>2</sub> = (1.44/1.00) sin 30<sup>o</sup> = 1.44 (0.500) = 0.720<br>
θ<sub>2</sub> = sin<sup>-1</sup> (0.720) = 46<sup>o</sup><br>
This time we notice that the angle of refraction is larger than the angle of incidence. This indicates that the 
light is bending away from the normal as it enters a rarer material.</p>
